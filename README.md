This is a sample project showcasing macros integration in a Maven project on an example taken from [here](http://scalamacros.org/documentation/gettingstarted.html).

To see for yourself that everything goes fine clone it and run `mvn clean compile` from its root directory. The compilation should finish with success signifying that the macros transformation in the `core` module went fine.
